# Basic-Banking-System
Hello everyone, I have developed a basic banking system website during my internship at The Sparks Foundation

The system is a basic transaction platform designed for development and learning purposes. It enables customers to both send and receive money. Additionally, customers have the ability to review their past transactions. The system serves as a practical tool for understanding the fundamentals of transactional processes and is suitable for educational and developmental use.
